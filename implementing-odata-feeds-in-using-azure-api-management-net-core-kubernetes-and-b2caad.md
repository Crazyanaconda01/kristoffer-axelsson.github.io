## Implementing Odata feeds in using Azure API Management .Net Core, Kubernetes and B2CAAD

### Use case
OData is an ISO/IEC approved, OASIS standard REST standard and is intended to be used to expose and access information from a variety of sources like relational databases, file systems, content management systems, and traditional web applications. I worked with fulfulling the business case of the client, which was to offer the same or similar anaytlical capabilites to the customers as Microsoft offers. In practice meaning generating an .odc file that can be consumed by i.e. PowerBi, Excel etc. Belows some articles regareding my experiences of implementing OData services using .Net Core, Azure APIM and CosmosDB.
